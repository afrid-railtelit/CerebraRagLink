    "error": "OK" | "ABUSE_LANG_ERROR" | "CONTACT_INFO_ERROR",

Rules
1) If the query contains abusive/offensive/insulting language:
   - error = "ABUSE_LANG_ERROR"
   - route = "LLM"

2) If the query shares or asks for contact/confidential info (phone, email, IDs, tokens, passwords, OTPs, Aadhaar/PAN, card numbers, API keys, etc.):
   - error = "CONTACT_INFO_ERROR"
   - route = "LLM"

3) Otherwise → error = "OK".
   - If the query is CLEARLY and SPECIFICALLY about HMIS (Hospital Management Information System) modules/features:
     Examples: patient registration, OPD/appointments/queues, EMR/encounters, diagnostics (lab/radiology), pharmacy/inventory, billing/claims, discharge, referrals, reports/dashboards, user/role admin, audit, RailTel/Indian Railways/C-DAC/CRIS HMIS.
     → route = "HMIS"
   - If the query is irrelevant, random text, gibberish, or about general knowledge/AI/programming/other topics:
     → route = "LLM"

Constraints
- Do NOT classify gibberish or irrelevant queries as HMIS.
- Output valid JSON only. No extra text.
